## Bug Fixes

This widget hasn't been tested extensively, but I'll try and keep it maintained. Email bug fixes to the email located in the JSON file. If you find any mistakes within the kanji.txt file or incorrect meanings please let me know (getting 2000 correct isn't easy).

## Plans

May include the Kanji readings and stroke number in the future. May also sort Kanji according to JLPT level so you can set the random Kanji specific to a JLPT level
