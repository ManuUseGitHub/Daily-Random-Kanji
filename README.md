A widget made for [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) using _CoffeeScript_  
Shows a new random Kanji on your desktop everyday including it's ID, meaning and reading.
The Kanji list in *kanji.txt* was compiled from the following list:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_j%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji>

## Customization

The range of Kanji displayed can be modified by altering the numeric value after "RANDOM" in the command line to the following values:

<center>

| Grade | Value  |
|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | 81 |
| 2 | 241 |
| 3 | 441 |
| 4 | 641 |
| 5 | 828 |
| 6 | 1009 |
| S | 2139 |

</center>

The current version lists ID, the kanji and it's meaning. The japanese reading can be added by adding a new *div* to both the *render* and *update* methods. Make sure the command is showing the correct file path, depending on how your files are arranged.


## Bug Fixes

This widget hasn't been tested extensively, but I'll try and keep it maintained. Email bug fixes to the email located in the JSON file. If you find any mistakes within the kanji.txt file or incorrect meanings/readings please let me know.
